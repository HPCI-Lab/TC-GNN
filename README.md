# TC-GNN

### Description

The TC-GNN repository contains the modules of a deep learning pipeline that can pre-process and train a Graph Neural Network on structured data(ERA5 + IBTrACS).
The network can then be used to detect tropical cyclones using a GNN approach instead of the classical CNN.

### How to Setup

For this process, you need Python already available on the system.

```
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
```
