# FESOM2 unstructured pipeline
This section will contain the Python scripts for the processing of unstrutured FESOM2 grids for the identification of oceanic eddies. They're not in form of notebooks because I expect to run them on Levante machines, from DKRZ. They are instead runnable in blocks within Visual Studio Code thanks to Jupyter.

## List of files:
 * pre_processing.py	->	Produces a NetCDF file containing only the nodes and edges of a Region of Interest in the mesh
